# React Boilerplate

Following the egghead.io course on Modern Javascript Tooling with React, this repo can be used a boilerplate for starting a new project.

Setup includes:

- Testing with Jest
- Linting and formatting with Prettier and ESLint
- React.StrictMode to avoid deprecated React API's
- Accessibility issue checks with react-axe
- Error boundary
- Style loader to import CSS automatically
- git Hooks with Husky to run linting, formatting and tests before committing
- Hot loading in development
